# Mini-TE

Mini-TE: A Distributed Framework for Traffic Engineering of SDN Data Paths.

This tutorial describes how to install a complete
environment for OpenFlow 1.3 experiments in an emulated
network with Mininet.
We evaluate the communication between Mininets in
separated physical hosts with Open vSwitch 2.5.0,
DB Schema 7.12.1, and dpctl 1.3. 

How to start?

```
# git clone https://github.com/mininet/mininet.git
