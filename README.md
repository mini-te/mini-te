Mini-TE: A Distributed Framework for Traffic Engineering of SDN Data Paths.

This tutorial describes how to install a complete
environment for OpenFlow 1.3 experiments in an emulated

We evaluate the communication between Mininets in
separated physical hosts with Open vSwitch 2.5.0,
DB Schema 7.12.1, and dpctl 1.3.
